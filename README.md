# So Long

Welcome to my "So Long" game repository! This is a simple 2D game developed as part of a learning project to get hands-on experience with graphical applications in C using the MiniLibX library. In this game, you'll navigate through a map collecting items and finding your way to the exit.

## Introduction

"So Long" is a small 2D game where the goal is to collect all items on the map and escape. This is 42's common-core first graphic project designed to introduce us to basic game development concepts, including window management, event handling, texture, and sprite management.
