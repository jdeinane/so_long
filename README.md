Minishell Project
Welcome to the Minishell project repository! This project aims to build a simple yet functional UNIX command interpreter, similar to a minimalistic version of bash or sh. It's designed to get you familiar with system calls, processes, and the environment of a Unix-like operating system.

Introduction
In this project, we delve into the basics of creating a shell interface that executes commands read from the standard input. You'll learn about process creation, execution, and communication, enhancing your understanding of the operating system's workings.

Objectives
The Minishell project will solidify your skills in several areas:

Process creation and synchronization
Environment management
Proper error handling and signal processing
Parsing and interpreting a simple command
